Description: This package provides an easy way to test hypotheses 
    about continous predictors in multiple regression. A hypothesis
	may for example be that variable1 and variable2 both have a 
	positive correlation with the outcome variable, but that the 
	correlation of variable1 is stronger. This package enables 
	formal testing of such hypotheses and is particularly useful
	for testing multiple contradicting hypotheses.
