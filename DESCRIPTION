Description: This package provides an easy way to test hypotheses 
    about continuous predictors in multiple regression. Simply fit
	a linear model in R with `lm`, specify your hypotheses and test
	them with `test_hyp`. The package enables formal testing of
	hypotheses using a default Bayesian prior and is particularly
	useful for testing multiple contradicting hypotheses.
